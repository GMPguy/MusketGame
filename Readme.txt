About

The following application is a VR technological demo, where you can shoot stuff with 18th and 19th century firearms!
Aside from testing your marksman skills, you’ll get to experience the elaborate and tedious reloading procedure of the flintlock muzzleloaders.
Worry not though; the gun interactions have been designed to be very forgiving and intuitive. As long as you know the right steps, you’ll have no problems reloading and using them!
Currently there are three guns: a pistol, brown bess musket, and a baker rifle. There are two ways of reloading: via cartridges, and by loading everything manually.

Development

This demo was created in ~3 weeks, mainly during March 2024. It’s goal was twofold: to learn how to make a VR game in Unity, and to have a VR project in my portfolio, for the purpose of finding an internship. Both succeeded :D
Though, due to plethora of duties (internship, job, bachelor thesis, and other projects), there hasn’t been any update since. I also do not expect to work on this project for the time being.
There is however, a possibility that – should the right circumstances become evident – the project might get developed into something more sophisticated.
